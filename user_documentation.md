4. Once you are done, you will be displayed a "Thanks!" screen. At this point, the appropriate scientist will be emailed a notification about the new sighting.

Verify a sighting
-----------------

A scientist should be able to verify a sighting.

1. When a new sighting is made, the appropriate scientist will automatically be contacted - prompting them to validate the sighting. The scientist will be emailed a link to the new sighting, which will redirect them to the validation wizard.
2. The validation wizard will display a list of conditional checkboxes at the top of the screen. These should be filled out according to the sighting data below. Additionally, the sighting data may be freely modified by the scientist at this stage, if required. There are two stages of the checkbox validation; clicking the `Next step` button will proceed to the next step of the wizard.
3. Upon completing the checkbox validation - a final assessment will be presented. This assessment details whether the sighting was valid or invalid, based on the result of the checkboxes selected by the scientist. At this stage, the scientist may add additional comments to the sighting - and also select a different template to be emailed to the sighter, or modify the default selected template.
4. Once done, the `Next step` button should be pressed. This will update the sighting with the data provided by the scientist, and email the sighter with the appropriate information. If this was a valid sighting, it will now be displayed on the site. Otherwise, if it was invalid, it will be hidden from the site. The scientist will be redirected to the scientist panel.

Scientist panel

The scientist should be able to see any sightings assigned to them, and verify their validity.
